**😌 #PlaywrightAgents (Newest release from Playwright)
**
🧪 **What I implemented:**
• Tried Planner agent for app exploration
• Generated Playwright test scripts from Planner output
• Ran scripts using Healer to auto-fix failures
• Added assertions and improved locator strategy
• Documented workflow for learning & sharing

I read 1-2 weeks back about these agents and just thought wow thats great. Last week while discussing with my Senior QA, he asked me "Did you actually try them out?" That's when I decided to explore the new Playwright Agents and honestly super excited about how they’re reshaping test automation workflows. Currently, observed that these AI-powered helpers are exclusive to Node.js so would support just JS/TS for now.

➜ Think of them as a 3-member intelligent QA squad, each handing over the torch to the next:

**Planner → Generator → Healer
(Explores) (Creates) (Fixes)**

**Agent Planner:** The Explorer & Strategist
 The Planner roams your app like a curious detective, mapping out what needs to be tested and how.
📝 What it does:
 • Creates structured test plans
 • Suggests validations and flows
 • Outputs a blueprint that others can execute
You give it a URL and hints. It gives you detailed test scenarios like a QA architect on caffeine.

**Agent Generator:** The Coder in the Crew
 Once the Planner does the brainy part, the Generator rolls up its sleeves and writes the actual Playwright automated scripts.
🔧 What it does:
 • Reads the test plan
 • Generates automation-ready tests
 • Keeps everything Playwright-friendly
It turns ideas into runnable code faster than you can sip your chai.

Plan → Code → Run

**Agent Healer:** The Automatic Debugger
 This one is like that teammate who fixes things before you even notice they broke.
💡 What it does:
 • Executes the generated tests
 • Detects failures in real time
 • Has access to Planner + Generator context
 • Repairs scripts by understanding root causes
Imagine flaky tests… quietly healed!

Now, what does this mean? Will these agents replace testers? Nope. Will they make us insanely productive? YES.
 **Quick comparison:**
 • Not a full manual replacement
 • Reduces automation effort by ~50–60%
 • We still need to guide on quality and validations
 • AI handles the repetitive heavy lifting
So we move from “writing everything manually” to “reviewing + refining while AI assists”.
